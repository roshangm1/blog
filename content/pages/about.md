Hi! I am working as a Senior React Native Engineer in London, UK.

I have expertise with Javascript, React & React Native to be more exact. I love open source and I try to contribute back.

I believe in community and love to organize and participate in meetups, conferences all over the world. I am currently leading a local [Javascript Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ktmjs/) in Nepal. I am one of the organizer of an international conference in Nepal [Web Weekend Kathmandu (WWKTM)](https://wwktm.co). I even talk about it at JSConf EU 2019.

I believe in team work and love working with the motivated people. 

Moreover, I like football, love to travel/hike.\
