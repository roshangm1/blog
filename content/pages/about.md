Hi! I am a software engineer and co-founder at Brainants Technology. It's a software company based on Kathmandu, Nepal.

I have expertise with Javascript,  React & React Native to be more exact. I love open source and I try to contribute back.

I believe in community and love to organize and participate in meetups, conferences all over the world. I am currently leading a local [Javascript Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ktmjs/) in Nepal. I am one of the organizer of an international conference in Nepal [Web Weekend Kathmandu (WWKTM)](https://wwktm.co). I even talk about it at JSConf EU 2019.

I believe in team work and love working with the motivated people. 

Moreover, I like football (soccer), love to travel in my free time and big fond of aviation industry. Odd but I do like aircrafts and even airports. :D
